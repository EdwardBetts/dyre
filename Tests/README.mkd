Dyre Test Suite
===============

It's hard to design an automated testing system which can cope with a
program that recompiles itself on the fly, much less test the logic
behind those recompilations.

As a result, Dyre's tests are very high-level. They consist of a set of
source files and a shell script which will compile and run the resulting
binary. Test success is determined entirely based on the output of the
programs.
