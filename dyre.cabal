Synopsis:      Dynamic reconfiguration in Haskell

Description:   Dyre implements dynamic reconfiguration facilities after the
               style of Xmonad. Unlike Yi's HConf, Dyre doesn't bother to
               implement support for restarting and persisting state. Instead,
               Dyre narrows its focus down to the task of compiling and running
               custom binaries based on user configurations.
